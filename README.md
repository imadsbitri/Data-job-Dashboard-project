# 📊 Data Jobs Around the World - Power BI Project

## 🧩 Overview
This Power BI project explores **data jobs around the world**, providing insights into job distribution, salary ranges, and market trends.  
The goal was to create an interactive dashboard to analyze and visualize job-related data efficiently.

---

## 📥 1. Data Loading
The project begins by **loading multiple data sources**, including:  
- **CSV files** containing job listings and salary information  
- **Excel files** containing regional and company data  

Before loading, some **initial data manipulation** was performed in Excel — such as cleaning, formatting, and organizing columns — to ensure data consistency and structure.  

After that, Power BI’s **Get Data** feature was used to connect and import all prepared datasets into the workspace for further transformation and analysis.

---

## 🔧 2. Data Transformation (Power Query)
Data cleaning and transformation were performed using **Power Query Editor**, applying several key steps and features:
- Removing duplicates and handling missing values  
- Changing data types for consistency  
- Merging and appending multiple datasets  
- Creating calculated columns  
- Splitting and combining columns for better structure  
- Filtering and sorting data  
- Using conditional columns to categorize job roles and salary levels  

---

## 🔗 3. Data Modeling
After transformation, relationships were built between tables to ensure accurate analysis and reporting:
- Established **one-to-many** and **many-to-many** relationships between fact and dimension tables  
- Defined primary and foreign keys for data integrity  
- Created a clean **data model schema** optimized for report performance

## 📈 4. Measures and Calculations (DAX)
Using **Data Analysis Expressions (DAX)** to create dynamic and insightful measures such as:
- Total Jobs  
- Average Salary  
- Job Growth by Country  
- Percentage of Remote Jobs  
- Dynamic Rankings and KPIs  

---

## 🎨 5. Visualization and Reporting
The visual layer of the project includes:
- Interactive charts and maps for geographical insights  
- Slicers and filters for user-driven exploration  
- Cards, KPIs, and trend visuals to summarize key metrics  
- Customized visuals for a clean, professional layout
